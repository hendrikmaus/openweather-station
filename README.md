# ðŸ“¡ OpenWeather Station

> An open source weather station that uses the [OpenWeather Station API 3.0](https://openweathermap.org/stations) for a backend.

## ðŸ”¬ Features

- Measurements
  - Temperature
  - Humidty
  - Atmospheric pressure
  - Wind speed
  - Wind direction
  - Rain amount
- Solar Powered
- Connectivity
  - WiFi
  - SIM card
  - LoRa

Please also find the unofficial [companion app](https://github.com/hendrikmaus/openweather-station-companion-app) to manage your station and quickly retrieve its measurements on the go.

_<sup>1</sup> Depending on your chosen type of connectivity, you may find readily available ESP32 boards with, for example, a SIM800L on-board. To optimize for low-power operation, you should consider to not use a development board, but a bare ESP32 chip. However, a development board should be fine, even in countries with little sun in winter, since the MCU will be in deep sleep most of the time._

_<sup>2</sup> If you decide for LoRa, please choose the appropriate frquency band for your location._

_<sup>3</sup> Choosing the SIM800L requires you to also purchase a SIM card with some sort of data plan. I went with ThingsMobile for testing._

_<sup>4</sup> I did not include the wind direction measurement in my build as of 2020/09_

_<sup>5</sup> Mounting the station to a building would invalidate multiple sensor readings, e.g. heat radiates from a wall, the rain gauge might be partially shielded, the anemometer might be blocked but wind still present etc._

> You can decide to either extend or reduce the sensors of your station; please have a look at what the [API](https://openweathermap.org/stations#measurement) supports.
